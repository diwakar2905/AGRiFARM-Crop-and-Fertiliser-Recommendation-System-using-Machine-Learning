üåü Overview
Modern agriculture requires data-driven decisions for optimal yield and sustainability. This project utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to provide actionable recommendations for both crop selection and fertilizer application, tailored to specific soil nutrients and environmental conditions. By analyzing parameters like nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall, the system empowers users to make informed choices that boost productivity and soil health.

üöÄ Features
Crop Recommendation: Suggests the best crops for given soil and environmental parameters.

Fertilizer Recommendation: Recommends optimal fertilizers to maximize crop yield and maintain soil health.

User-Friendly Web App: Interactive and intuitive interface for seamless user experience.

Data Visualization: Graphical representation of predictions and input data.

High Accuracy: Employs multiple machine learning models for reliable results.

üìä Datasets

üß† Model Architectures
Crop Recommendation
Algorithms Used:

Decision Tree

Gaussian Naive Bayes

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

XGBoost

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Best Model: Random Forest (Accuracy: 99.55%)

Fertilizer Recommendation
Algorithm Used: [Specify, e.g., Decision Tree]

Accuracy: [Specify if available]

üèóÔ∏è System Architecture
The system is structured into two main modules:

Crop Recommendation Module: Processes soil and environmental parameters to predict the most suitable crop.

Fertilizer Recommendation Module: Suggests the optimal fertilizer based on selected crop and soil nutrients.

Both modules are integrated into a web application for a smooth user workflow.

üìà Results
Crop Recommendation:

Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy (99.55%).

Other models like XGBoost and Gaussian Naive Bayes also performed well.

Fertilizer Recommendation:
